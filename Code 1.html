From the Tea Party, to Ron Paul, the MAGA movement, and now its final culmination in the New Right. Led under the banner of President Vance, they have seized many of the keys to power, and now their final victory is in sight.<br><br>On the other, the Regime. The aging progressive technocracy whose creativity has long been exhausted. The forces of the rusting machine that has been in retreat to the forces of the New Right for decades now. Once, they controlled everything. Now, they are on the verge of losing everything. Its institutions are old and frail, and even its supporters know the Regime is drawing its final breaths. Its only hope is that the Movement might divide itself, and it stay in power just a little bit longer.",
